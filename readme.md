# LCH-Taskbar

This is a prototype to make myself a complete custom taskbar for windows.

The project `lch-taskbar-wpf` contains the taskbar components and other stuff. 
Taskbar is always at the top, but you can modify the starting value so it is where you want it.

The project `lch-windows` has some code to get the process with visible windows. The rest is currently not used, but I planned to make something like i3 with it.

## How to use

Download and compile the code. Then run the .exe.

Using net7.0.

For the `Everything` and `Spotify` button, you need those program installed.
